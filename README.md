# Sudoku Solver
This program allows a user to check if a Sudoku puzzle solution is valid, or automatically solve an incomplete puzzle. The program will notify the user if inputs are invalid or no solution is found.

Sudoku is a logic game. A board contains a 9x9 grid of tiles, also divided into 3x3 sub-grids. Each row, column, and sub-grid must contain all numbers between 1 and 9 inclusive with no duplicates.
